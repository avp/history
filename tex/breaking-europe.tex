\chapter{The Sundering of Europe}

\section{The Fall of Rome}

In the fourth century, Rome's influence in the Western world was unparalleled.
The empire had conquered much of the known world by the time of Constantine,
and even though it was split into multiple parts, it held quite a bit of sway
in Europe and in Northern Africa.
So, the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century was a big turning point in history.

In 378, the Goths were invading the Roman empire (they were running from the Huns),
and the Roman emperor \textbf{Valens} fought them at \textbf{Adrianople}.
Prior to the battle, Valens had given the \textbf{Visigoths} the status of foederati, and let them live across the Danube.
They had even helped the Romans fight the Huns.
But now, the invading army was comprised of:
the Thervings (Visigoths), led by Fritigern;
Bacurius the Iberian;
and the Greutungs, led by Alatheus and Saphrax.
Valens died at the battle (a result of being abandoned by his guards),
and the new emperor Gratian came to power as a result.
The Goths won a decisive victory, striking a resounding blow against the might of the Romans.
Adrianople is often considered the beginning of the fall of western Rome,
despite the actual battle being fought by soldiers in the Eastern Roman Empire.

Gratian's reign ended in 383 when Magnus Maximus, emperor in the West, attacked Gaul and killed him.
Theodosius~I became emperor.
Theodosius fought these civil wars with the West,
and upon defeating Maximus, he appointed Valentinian II as Augustus in the West.

During the reign of Theodosius, a half-Vandal Roman general named Stilicho
was appointed guardian of the young future emperor Honorius.
At this point, \textbf{Alaric~I} of the Balti dynasty became the leader of the Visigoths,
the same people known as the Thervings at Adrianople, after the death of Fritigern.
The Visigoths had separated from the Ostrogoths, who had gone their own way.
Alaric tried to rebel a couple times, but he was stopped by Stilicho.
Stilicho made peace with Alaric, who joined the Romans and was no longer considered an enemy.

In 410, Stilicho was disgraced (a victim of conspiracy) and hunted down and killed.
Alaric was again an enemy of the empire, so he went on the offensive.
At this time, Rome was not really the capital of the Western Roman Empire
(oddly enough, that title had been given to Ravenna),
but it was still considered an eternal city, and was still a central point of the empire.
Now, Rome itself had not been touched by any enemy since 387 BC, when it had been sacked by Brennus.
First, Alaric invaded Greece, killing many and wiping out the Eleusinian Mysteries.
Alaric invaded Italy, and besieged Rome, and tried to negotiate, three times.
On the third siege, Alaric got annoyed and entered the city,
pillaging and ransacking a lot of the big important buildings,
but on the whole, not causing a particularly massive amount of damage.
The sacking prompted \textbf{St.\ Augustine} to write \textit{City of God}.
Augustine would later die during the Vandal siege.

Meanwhile, elsewhere in the empire, Honorius's lands were breaking.
Constantine~III, last of the imperial usurpers, managed to raise an army in Britain, and march on Gaul.
He defeated Sarus (who was loyal to Honorius), and co-ruled with Honorius for a time.
The Visigoths went west from Italy, and ruled Spain from their capital at Toledo.
The Vandals settled in the south of Spain.
Other barbarian tribes settled into parts of Spain and Gaul, splitting the empire even further.

In 444, the Huns were united by \textbf{Attila} (the ``Scourge of God''),
who also included many Germanic tribes in his subjects.
Attila had taking the kingship after his brother Bleda had died.
He kept attacking the Eastern empire until 450, making money,
but always stopping at the walls of Constantinople.
He claimed the Emperor's sister Honoria as his wife,
and he invaded Gaul in 451 to get his ``dowry'', which was half of the Western Roman Empire.
The invasion was stopped by Flavius Aetius and the Visigoths under Theodoric~I,
at the Catalunian Plains and at Chalons.
Allegedly, Pope Leo~I convinced Attila not to attack Rome ---
soon after, Attila died of a nosebleed in his sleep.

By 439, the \textbf{Vandals} had crossed the Strait of Gibraltar, moved east, and taken Carthage from Rome.
They set up a new kingdom in Northern Africa, where they would reside for a century.
Genseric was their king, and his son the prince was named Huneric.
After going back and forth trying to attack Italy, they got their true chance when Valentinian killed Aetius,
and in 455, the Vandals managed to enter Rome itself, and plunder it for two weeks.
Now, their name is obviously synonymous with someone who defaces property.
They sailed away with lots of gold, and conquered Sicily.
From this point onwards, their ships were a menace to the Romans.

In 476, a former soldier named Odoacer had invaded Rome.
He deposed the 16 year old emperor Romulus~Augustulus, but did not kill him.
Odoacer became the first ruler of Italy after Rome, and ended the Western Roman Empire.

\section{Building a Holy Roman Empire}

While Rome's world was collapsing around it, some new dynasties were being created
in what used to be the province of Gaul.
The region was now called Francia, and it was ruled by the Franks, a bunch of Germanic tribes.

\subsection*{Merovingian Kingdom}

In the fifth century, while Rome was falling,
\textbf{Childeric~I}, son of Merovech, leader of the Salian Franks, founded the \textbf{Merovingian dynasty}.
Legend has it that Childeric's father was a half-fish, half-bull monster, but that's probably not true.
When Childeric died, he was buried in Saint Brice in Tournai,
with a golden bull's head and lots of golden insects (bees, cicadas, etc.).

Childeric's son was \textbf{Clovis~I} (481-511), the greatest of the Merovingian rulers.
He was married to Clotilde, and he adopted Christianity, being baptized in 496.
He would unite Gaul under his rule, and would defeat the remaining Romans,
(led by Syagrius, the last Roman official of Gaul), at the Battle of Soissons.
At the Battle of Vouill\'e (507), he allied with Anastasius~I (Byzantine Emperor)
and defeated the Visigoths under Alaric~II, conquerer of Spain.
Gregory of Tours would refer to Clovis as a ``new Constantine'' when he wrote his \textit{Histories}.
He would be buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles that he built in Paris.

When Clovis died, his kingdom was divided among his four sons.
To the outside world, these four separate polities were still all the Merovingian kingdom.
Eventually Clotaire~II reunited the realm, and his son Dagobert~I was the last powerful Merovingian king.
Dagobert expelled the Jews on the urging of Heraclius, who had prophesied the fall of Byzantium.
After Dagobert, the kings were known as the ``idle kings'' or the ``do-nothing kings''.

In 687, Pepin the Middle came to power by winning the Battle of Tertry.
Pepin's son, the prince \textbf{Charles~``The Hammer''~Martel} would also assume power.
His sons, Carloman and \textbf{Pepin~the~Short}, would appoint Childeric~III as the new king.
Pepin was annoyed at not having the title of the King, even though he ruled the Franks,
because Childeric~III didn't do much, and Carloman had decided to become a monk or something.
Pepin also had another brother Grifo, but he wasn't a huge opposition.
So, Pepin deposed Childeric~III, and colluded with Pope Zachary to get himself elected king.

\subsection*{Carolingian Empire}

Pepin the Short was the first \textbf{Carolingian} king.
He had a good relationship with the papacy, as shown by his earlier consultation with Zachary.
He helped pope Stephen~II when he helped intervene with the Lombards (a Germanic tribe)
in Italy at battles such as Pavia,
and Stephen~II helped Pepin by crowning him.
He gave the captured lands to the pope, as part of the ``Donation of Pepin''.
In 768, Pepin died, and even though his reign would not be as impressive as his son's,
he was certainly a highly successful ruler.

Pepin's son, who succeeded him, was \textbf{Charlemagne}, who co-ruled with his brother Carloman~I.
He married Desiderata, as a show of alliance with the Lombards.
Carloman died in 771, and Charlemagne was the sole ruler of the Franks.
With his brother's death, he broke his alliance.
He conquered the Lombards led by Desiderius in Italy, and became their king,
and he continued his father's good relationship with the pope,
leading troops into Muslim controlled Spain.
He led campaigns against people who lived east of him, forcing Christianity on them under penalty of death,
a policy that resulted in the Massacre of Verden.
A leading scholar in his court in Aachen was Alcuin,
who led a ``Carolingian Renaissance'', and established the Palatine school.
On Christmas Day, 800, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Leo~III\@.
Charlemagne is often referred to as the ``Father of Europe'',
because he united much of the West for the first time since Rome.
When he died, he was succeeded by Louis the Pious.

Charlemagne and the Franks had recreated a new empire that strove to be as impressive as Rome itself.
This new \textbf{Holy Roman Empire}, as it would soon be known,
would play a major role in history for centuries to come.

\section{Islamic Caliphates}

\textbf{Muhammad} of Mecca united a large portion of the world under Islam.
Muslims believe that he was a prophet of God.
He died in 632, in Medina.

\subsection*{Rashidun Caliphate (632--661)}

The Rashidun were the ``rightly-guided caliphs''.
\textbf{Abu Bakr}, the first caliph to succeed Muhammad, named Umar as his rightful successor.
After Umar was Uthman.
When Uthman died, a conflict called the first Fitna (Islamic civil war) began.
During this time, \textbf{Ali} came to power for a violent five years.
The followers of Abu Bakr were called Sunni Muslims, and the followers of Ali were Shi'a Muslims.

The Rashidun spread across all of the Arabian peninsula and much of modern day Iran,
with small portion of Northern Africa.
It was in fact the largest empire ever built up to that point in history.

After Ali's reign, his son Hasan was elected as caliph, but he gave the caliphate to Mu'awiyah instead.

\subsection*{Umayyad Caliphate (661--750)}

Mu'awiyah established the Umayyad caliphate, which expanded across all of north Africa,
and crossed the Strait of Gibraltar to control much of Iberia as well.
It became the fifth-largest empire ever created in history, and the largest up to that point,
and its capital was located at Damascus.

In 732, the Umayyad fought the \textbf{Battle of Tours} against Charles~Martel, the Hammer of the Franks.
The battle took place in northern France, close to the Frankish border.
The Franks won a decisive victory, and the Umayyad army was forced to dial down their ambition.
It was actually at Tours that Charles earned the name ``Martel'', meaning Hammer.
The battle laid the foundation for what would become the Carolingian empire, as discussed in that section.
The Umayyads also lost in 740 to the Byzantines at Akroinon.

Notable caliphs during this time include Yazid~I and Mu'awiyah~II\@.
The last ruler of the Umayyad was Marwan~II\@.
In 747, a huge rebellion began against the caliphate, started by people who were annoyed at a distant government.
So, in 750, Marwan~II fought an Abbasid army at the Battle of the Zab, on the banks of the Great Zab river.
The Abbasids killed Marwan and ended the rule of the Umayyads.

\subsection*{Abbasid Caliphate (750--1517)}

The Abbasid set up Baghdad as a major city, until it was sacked in 1258.
In the 9th century, they created an army that was meant only to fight for them.
These slave soldier were called \textbf{Mamluks}, and eventually, they would control Egypt.
The ruler al-Mu'tasim moved the capital from Baghdad to Samarra, and the Mamluks slowly gained power.

At one point, the dynasty was opposed by Banu and Babak Khorramdin.
During the Anarchy at Samarra, Turkish chiefs fought for control.
Because the Abbasids lasted so long, we'll probably see more of them later.
