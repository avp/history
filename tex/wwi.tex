\section{Mexican Revolution}

I have nowhere else to put this, so it's going here,
because the Mexican Revolution was running concurrently with the Great War.

In 1910, a major revolution against Mexican ruler \textbf{Porfirio Diaz} broke out.
The revolution would last for most of the decade, and it evolved from a revolt into a civil war,
including such offshoots as a Bandit War and a Border War.
The uprising was initially led by \textbf{Francisco Madero}.
By 1911, Madero was put into power, following a massive election victory.
In 1913, the Ten Tragic Days (Decena Tragica) ended with both Madero and his Vice President Jose Suarez dead.

Following Madero's assassination, \textbf{Victoriano Huerta} came to power.
He signed the Embassy Pact with Taft's ambassador Henry Lane Wilson.
But, Woodrow Wilson decided not to acknowledge Huerta's new regime.

Opposition to Huerta was led by \textbf{Venustiano Carranza}, a rancher from Coahuila.
He organized a Constitutionalist army with the support of the US,
and started to fight against Huerta.
Germany supported Huerta,
because they wanted to keep the US distracted from their war in Europe.
When Carranza took power, Huerta fled to the United States
(a slightly concerning move from the American perspective).

\textbf{Pancho Villa} led an army called the Villistas and joined Madero's movement.
He'd led the attacks on Ciudad Jua\'rez which took Diaz from power.
After Madero's death, Villa amassed a sizable army (the Northern Division),
and helped Carranza fight Huerta.
However, Villa wanted to continue the revolution,
and he deposed Carranza at the Convention of Aguascalientes in favor of Eulalio Guti\'errez.
He fought at Celaya against Carranza in a couple major battles.

Villa crossed the border into the US in 1916 and raided Columbus, New Mexico.
President Wilson sent General John J. Pershing on the Punitive Expedition into Mexico to capture Villa.
Pershing defeated Villa at Carrizal,
but failed to catch him after a year of chasing Villa around Mexico,
so Pershing was sent to WWI by Wilson instead.
Villa retired in 1920,
and he was killed in 1923 by gunmen while he was sitting in his car in Hidalgo del Parral.

\textbf{Emiliano Zapata}, leader of the Liberation Army of the South,
is considered a national hero of Mexico.
Peasants and poor Mexicans rallied to Zapata's battle cry of ``Tierra y Libertad'' (Land and Liberty),
and he laid out reforms in his Plan of Ayala.
However, he was opposed by some powerful people including the Figueroa brothers.
He said that it was ``better to die on your feet than live on your knees''.
In 1919, Zapata was killed by Pablo Gonzales and Jesus Guajardo in an ambush.

Near the end of the war, six Americans were killed by Villistas near Ruby, Arizona, in the Ruby Incident.
