\subsection*{Harry Truman}

Let's talk about Harry S.\ Truman, Roosevelt's final Vice President.
Truman was born in Missouri, and he joined Tom Pendergast's political machine in Kansas City.
As discussed before, Truman assumed the presidency just before the Nazis surrendered,
and he ordered dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Truman ran for reelection in 1948.
His opponent was \textbf{Thomas Dewey}, a New York Republican.
Also running was \textbf{Strom Thurmond}, who had shown up from South Carolina with the support of Dixiecrats,
and formed the States' Rights Democratic Party with his running mate Fielding Wright.
During the election, Truman criticized the ``Do-Nothing Congress'' for opposing his Fair Deal.
On election day, the Chicago Tribune preemptively announced election results: ``Dewey Defeats Truman!''
However, they were wrong because some polls weren't available, and Truman ended up winning reelection.
Truman's new cabinet included Secretary of State \textbf{Dean Acheson}.
