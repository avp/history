\subsection*{Harry Truman}

Let's talk about Harry S.\ Truman, Roosevelt's final Vice President.
Truman was born in Missouri, and he joined Tom Pendergast's political machine in Kansas City.
As discussed before, Truman assumed the presidency just before the Nazis surrendered,
and he ordered dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Truman ran for reelection in 1948.
His opponent was \textbf{Thomas Dewey}, a New York Republican.
Also running was \textbf{Strom Thurmond}, who had shown up from South Carolina with the support of Dixiecrats,
and formed the States' Rights Democratic Party with his running mate Fielding Wright.
During the election, Truman criticized the ``Do-Nothing Congress'' for opposing his Fair Deal.
On election day, the Chicago Tribune preemptively announced election results: ``Dewey Defeats Truman!''
However, they were wrong because some polls weren't available, and Truman ended up winning reelection.
Truman's new cabinet included Secretary of State \textbf{Dean Acheson}.

\subsection*{I Like Ike}

\textbf{Dwight David Eisenhower} was a five-star general in the United States Army,
serving as Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe during World War~II\@.
In 1952, he entered the Presidential race as a Republican.
His running mate was Richard M. Nixon, and he defeated the Adlai Stevenson/John Sparkman ticket in a landslide.

Eisenhower authorized Operation Ajax,
which deposed \textbf{Mohammad Mosaddegh}, prime minister of Iran, in a 1953 coup.
He also gave the go-ahead on Operation PBSUCCESS, targeting Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala,
ending the democratic government in Guatemala, ending the revolution,
and putting Carlos Castillo Armas in charge of a new military dictatorship.
His New Look policy was an attempt at nuclear deterrence in the face of the burgeoning Cold War.

In 1947, a young Wisconsin Senator named \textbf{Joseph McCarthy} took office,
having defeated Robert La Follette, Jr in 1946.
McCarthy had flown combat missions for the Marines during the war,
and he turned his nickname ``Tail-Gunner Joe'' into a campaign slogan: ``Congress needs a tail-gunner!''
In 1950, McCarthy came to prominence by giving a speech to the Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia:
\begin{quote}
  The bright young men who are born with silver spoons in their mouths are the ones who have been the worst.
  In my opinion, the State Department, which is one of the most important government departments,
  is thoroughly infested with Communists.
  I have in my hand 57 cases of individuals who would appear to be either card carrying members
  or certainly loyal to the Communist Party,
  but who nevertheless are still helping to shape our foreign policy.
\end{quote}
McCarthy quickly became the most well-known face in an anti-Communist witch hunt.
His modern Red Scare went until the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954,
until the Senate eventually voted to censure McCarthy.
Senator Joseph Welch said:
\begin{quote}
  Senator, may we not drop this?
  We know he belonged to the Lawyers Guild.
  Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator.
  You've done enough.
  Have you no sense of decency, sir?
  \textbf{At long last, have you left no sense of decency?}
\end{quote}

Eisenhower covertly opposed McCarthy while he was doing his whole crusade.
He was a mostly moderate conservative president, keeping around most of the New Deal programs.
He also launched the \textbf{Interstate Highway System} and DARPA\@.
In 1957, Orval Faubus opposed the enrollment of nine black students into Central High School in Little Rock.
Eisenhower sent in the 101st Airborne to intervene and make sure that they got into school.

In January 1961, Eisenhower gave his farewell address,
written by himself, his brother Milton, and his speechwriter Malcolm Moos:
\begin{quote}
  As we peer into society's future,
  we --- you and I, and our government --- must avoid the impulse to live only for today,
  plundering for, for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow.
  We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren
  without asking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage.
  We want democracy to survive for all generations to come,
  not to become \textbf{the insolvent phantom of tomorrow}.
\end{quote}
