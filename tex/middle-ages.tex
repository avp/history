\chapter{Medieval Times}

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Middle Ages began.
They would last until the start of the Renaissance in the 15th century,
and they were characterized by massive population growth and war in Europe.
Let's look at some areas of Europe in particular.

\section{England}

\subsection*{Anglo-Saxon England}

Near the beginning of the Middle Ages, the Anglo-Saxons lived in England,
a result of Germanic tribes moving north across the English Channel.
Anglo-Saxon England was traditionally considered a heptarchy, consisting of:
Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Sussex, and Wessex.
By the 7th century, much of the Anglo-Saxons had converted to Christianity,
and the Venerable Bede chronicled this era, earning him the title ``Father of English History''.

The kingdom of Mercia rose to prominence in the 7th century, building massive earthworks such as
Offa's Dyke, which separated modern-day Wales from the rest of England.
By the late 8th century, however, Viking raiders began to invade the island.
These Danes were led by Guthrum, whom we don't know much about before he seized control of the Danes.
They subdued East Anglia, capturing York.

\textbf{Alfred the Great}, king of Wessex, son of \AE{}thelwulf, fought back against Guthrum.
He created a network of fortified towns called burhs (these would be turned into boroughs eventually)
to defend Wessex and defeat the invaders, at battles such as Eddington and Ashdown.
Alfred confined Guthrum in a region that became known as the Danelaw, and proclaimed himself king of all the English.
His coronation was performed by Pope Leo IV, and
he compiled a census of England, called the Doom Book
(not to be confused with the Domesday Book that would be made later).
He remains the only English king to ever be called ``the Great''.

Alfred was eventually succeeded by Edgar the Peaceful, and by the end of Edgar's reign,
Wessex had taken control of the rest of England, including York and the Danelaw.
But, when Edgar died only two years after being crowned at Bath,
the issue of who should succeed to the throne was thrown into doubt.
His son Edward was crowned king, but he was quickly assassinated.

He was followed by Edgar's half-brother, \textbf{\AE{}thelred the Unready}.
As his epithet may suggest, his reign didn't go very well, even though he did rule for a long time.
It's now believed that he was simply the victim of bad counsel, and wasn't actually particularly ``unready''.
He had married Emma, a princess of Normandy.
While he was king, England was invaded by Danes again, led by Sweyn Forkbeard.
The Vikings pillaged through Essex, an action that resulted in the Battle of Maldon,
where the Vikings easily crushed the English.
From that point forward, the Vikings roamed the countryside, apparently free to take whatever they pleased,
while \AE{}thelred probably just hid in his basement.
Sweyn found \AE{}thelred and forced him into exile.
Soon after, though, Sweyn died, and \AE{}thelred was able to come back to England.

Angered at \AE{}thelred, \textbf{Cnut}, son of Sweyn, invaded England.
\AE{}thelred's son, Edmund Ironside, abandoned his father, and multiple English nobles took Cnut's side.
But, \AE{}thelred died, and Edmund was forced to fight the Danes.
At the battle of Ashingdon, the Danes overpowered the English, and Cnut and Edmund split England;
Edmund would take Wessex, and Cnut would take everything else.
When Edmund died (he was probably murdered), the English witan council declared Cnut king of England.
Cnut married \AE{}thelred's widow Emma,
and she agreed only because he agreed to allow her children to be heirs to the throne.
However, Cnut had had a previous wife, and her children also wanted the throne.

So, when Cnut died in 1035, the throne was disputed.
The claimants were Harald Harefoot, and Emma's son by Cnut, Harthacnut.
Emma's son by \AE{}thelred, Edward, tried to raid Southampton, but failed, and his brother Alfred was killed later.
Harthacnut became king, but he was unpopular, and nobody wanted his heirs to become king.
So, when he died, Edward came back from exile and was recognized as king.

Edward, who would come to be known as \textbf{Edward the Confessor},
married the daughter of Earl Godwin of Wessex, in order to secure an alliance.
But, when the citizens of Dover killed Edward's relative Eustace of Bolougne
(probably a response to Edward's appointment of Robert of Jumieges as Archbishop of Canterbury)
and Godwin refused to punish some people who killed Edward's relatives,
Edward had a falling out with Godwin, and the Godwins ran away to Normandy.
During the conflict, Edward was regularly working with and for the earls Siward and Leofric.
At this time, Edward probably offered the succession to his cousin, William, duke of Normandy.
However, soon after, the king reconciled with Godwin, and when Godwin died in 1053,
his son, \textbf{Harold~Godwinson}, acceded to the earldom in Wessex.
Godwin's other sons were given East Anglia, Mercia, and Northumbria.

In 1066, Edward the Confessor died, and Harold~Godwinson was declared king of England.
In the following year, England would be in turmoil because,
even though Harold had taken the crown, there were those who believed it wasn't his to take.
Remember that Edward had given a promise of succession to his cousin, William, duke of Normandy.
Also, \textbf{Harald~Hardrada} of Norway, descendant of Cnut, staked a claim to the throne.

Harold's brother Tostig, leader in Northumbria, allied himself with Hardrada.
Hardrada invaded Northern England, fighting the Battle of Fulford near York.
However, Hardrada was killed at Stamford Bridge by Harold~Godwinson's forces.

While Harold was celebrating his victory, William, Duke of Normandy, sailed for England.
Harold marched back south, where he met William at the \textbf{Battle of Hastings}, near Senlac Hill.
William crushed Harold's forces at Hastings, and Harold himself probably got an arrow through the eye.
The battle was chronicled on the \textbf{Bayeux Tapestry}, which notably shows Halley's comet.
As a result of his achievement, William is now known to us as \textbf{William the Conqueror}.

\subsection*{Anglo-Norman England}

William the Conqueror, now William~I, king of England, quickly moved to consolidate his power.
His people were revolting all over the place, and he crushed each one,
building a set of castles to control the populace.
These revolts included one led by the Earls Edwin and Morcar.
He led a massive and bloody expedition through the north of England,
killing those who stood in his way, called the Harrying of the North.
He commissioned a census of the country, and recorded it in the \textbf{Domesday Book}.
Orderic Vitalis, when chronicling William's rule,
claims that William admitted to being a ``barbarous murderer''
when he died in 1087 after falling off his horse at the Siege of Mantes.

William~II inherited his father's throne,
but he also faced revolts from his brother Robert or his cousin Stephen.
When William~II died in a hunting accident (we don't know if he was murdered),
his brother, Henry~I, quickly moved to take the crown.
He defeated Robert at Tinchebrai and kept power until he died in 1128.

On Henry's death, however, yet another power struggle broke out;
Matilda, Henry's daughter, disputed the claim of Stephen of Blois, Henry's nephew.
The civil war that broke out was called the Anarchy.

\subsection*{The Plantagenets}

Eventually, Matilda's son, \textbf{Henry~II} was crowned after a peace settlement.
Henry had been born in Anjou, making him the first of the Angevins,
and the first member of the House of \textbf{Plantagenet} to be king.
Henry married Eleanor of Aquitaine after her marriage to Louis~VII of France was annulled.
Henry got into disputes with the Church, and wanted power over them.
So, he appointed \textbf{Thomas Becket} to the position of Archbishop of Canterbury,
because Henry believed that Becket was a man that would be loyal to him.
But, Becket became a thorn in Henry's side, fighting to give the Church unrestricted power and freedom.
Henry didn't like this at all, and he issued the Constitutions of Clarendon
to restrict the power of Church courts and the power of the pope in England.
Becket resisted, and Henry exiled him to France.

However, by 1169, Henry wanted to crown his son Young Henry as king along with himself.
This required Becket to agree, so Henry tried to reconcile with him, but failed.
So, Henry crowned his son by himself, and Becket laid an interdict on England,
halting useful Church activity like weddings.
Eventually, Henry got fed up with Becket, and he got really mad, saying things like,
``Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?''
In response to this, four knights went secretly to Canterbury and killed Becket,
an act which would result in Becket being declared a martyr and being declared a saint.

Henry wanted some more territory for his sons, so he invaded Ireland, conquered it,
and set up local fiefdoms to rule over the island.
He then faced the Great Revolt in which elder sons, supported by France, rebelled.

Henry~II would be succeeded by \textbf{Richard~I, the Lionheart} in 1189,
because Henry's three eldest children, William, Henry, and Geoffrey, had died as young men.
Richard spent his reign mostly protecting his territory and fighting the Third Crusade in the East.

Richard's youngest brother, \textbf{John Lackland}, inherited the throne in 1199.
He negotiated the Treaty of Le Goulet with Philip Augustus of France in 1200.
When John abandoned Isabel of Gloucester in order to marry Isabella of Angul\^eme, the peace was broken.
John had claimed that he had not obtained papal consent to marry Isabel in the first place.
John took William de Roches, his seneschal, and defended his lands in Normandy, and won the Battle of Mirebeau.
However, Philip would later win the Battle of Bouvines against John and his allies.
The nobles would eventually lose faith in John, and at Runnymede, they forced him to sign \textbf{Magna Carta},
which gave them permission to overpower him if they didn't like what he did.
John eventually reneged on Magna Carta, and eventually the barons gave up and decided to revolt.
This resulted in the First Barons' War, and John would be succeeded by his son Henry.
