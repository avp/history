\section{Germany Divided}

The Second World War had killed almost 10\% of the German population.
The place was in shambles.
At Potsdam, the country had been divided into four zones by the Allies.
The country didn't regain independence until 1949.

In East Germany, Soviets ruled with an iron fist, employing the \textbf{Stasi} as the official state security.
From 1950 to 1971, the party boss in the area was \textbf{Walter Ulbricht}.
In 1953, Ulbricht's government had to put down an uprising using Soviet troops and tanks.

Berlin, deep in the heart of East Germany, was itself divided into separate occupation zones.
Stalin then decided to blockade West Berlin, disallowing any Allied supplies from reaching the city.
The Soviets introduced the Ostmark in their zone to combat the announcement of the new Deutsche Mark.
As a result, Lucius Clay, deputy governor of Germany, put Operation Vittles into effect.
The \textbf{Berlin Airlift}, as it was called,
aimed to fly two million tons of supplies into the city and drop them to the people below.
Construction for the bases occurred at places near Tempelhof and Lake Tegel.
Albert Wedemeyer, a general who had commanded the airlift from India over the Himalayan Hump, helped the effort.
The British contribution was codenamed Operation Plainfare,
and the Australian operation was designated Operation Pelican.

By 1961, 2.6 million people had fled from East Germany,
and Ulbricht created the \textbf{Berlin Wall} to try and stop them.
The wall was crossable in few locations, including Checkpoint Charlie,
and abandoned subway stops past the wall were called ``ghost stations''.
During the Berlin Wall crisis in 1961, Lucius Clay ordered tanks to a standoff to back up Albert Hemsing.

\section{US-Soviet Relations}

\subsection*{Truman and his Doctrine}

Following the victory in World War~II, Truman and friends helped set up the \textbf{United Nations}.
He also issued the \textbf{Truman Doctrine}, giving aid to Turkey and Greece, in an attempt to contain communism.
Truman's policy of containment was inspired partly by \textbf{George F.\ Kennan} (Mr.\ X)
and his writings talking about \textbf{containment} of communism.
Kennan sent the \textbf{Long Telegram} from Soviet Russia,
claiming that the Soviets were expansionist and needed to be contained in places that mattered to the US\@.

In order to help rebuild Europe, Secretary of State \textbf{George Marshall} came up with a strategy.
The \textbf{Marshall Plan} consisted of using \$13 billion to bring European economies back on track,
and William Clayton, Kennan, and Marshall unveiled the plan at a graduation speech at Harvard in 1947.
To counter the Marshall Plan, the Soviets put their own Molotov Plan into effect to help Eastern European countries.

\subsection*{NATO \& the Warsaw Pact}

In 1949, the former Allies formed the \textbf{North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)}.
Headquartered in Brussels, NATO's goal was to stop the growing Soviet threat.
They set up yearly readiness exercises named after Able Archer and Dean Rusk.

In response, the Soviets set up the \textbf{Warsaw Pact} in 1955.
Included in the organization were China and North Korea,
and during Zapad 81, they would carry out the largest military exercise ever.

\section{Korean War}

Korea had been ruled by Japan since 1910 until the later parts of World War~II\@.
Then, the Soviets took control of the peninsula north of the \textbf{38th parallel},
and US forces occupied the south, and Japan surrendered, packed up, and left.

Two separate governments were set up.
The south elected \textbf{Syngman Rhee} president in July 1948.
Rhee had converted to Christianity in High School, and he had spent time in America.
He opposed Communism, and as soon as he took power,
he started instituting laws against political dissent, smashing his leftist opponents.

In Communist North Korea, a new regime was established under \textbf{Kim Il-Sung}.
His symbol was a blue orchid that had been given to him by Sukarno, and he made it the official flower of the country.
He set up the kwan li so labor camps,
and he introduced the Juche (self-reliance) political ideology, displacing Stalin and Mao.
In 1968, his government would capture \textbf{USS Pueblo}, commanded by Captain Lloyd Bucher.

Now, both Rhee and Kim Il Sung wanted to unite Korea under their respective governments.
Stalin set up the North Koreans with weapons,
and they crossed the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950, fighting on the Ongjin peninsula.
They came south, forcing Rhee to leave Seoul and drastically reducing the headcount of South Korean troops.

At this point, the Truman administration wasn't really well prepared for military action in Korea.
There were worries as to what the Soviets would do if the US intervened in Korea.
Truman wrote:
\begin{quote}
  There was complete,
  almost unspoken acceptance on the part of everyone
  that whatever had to be done to meet this aggression had to be done.
  There was no suggestion from anyone that either the United Nations or the United States could back away from it.
\end{quote}
There was fear of a chain reaction allowing the Soviets to disregard the UN
and create Communist aggression in any number of other places across the world.
On June 27, after the UN Security Council ruled that the North Korean invasion was bad,
Truman sent the 8th Army into the peninsula to help the South Koreans.

The first significant American engagement came at the \textbf{Battle of Osan}.
The battle was unsuccessful,
and the North Korean KPA pushed the South Korean ROK and the US army back to \textbf{Pusan}.
Battles around this time included Onjong.
Kim Il-sung thought he would end the war by the end of August.

To relieve the Pusan perimeter, General MacArthur ordered the planning of a landing at \textbf{Inchon}.
The battle began with USS \textit{Mansfield}, USS \textit{Swenson}, and USS \textit{Collett} bombarding a fortress.
The X Corps then landed at Green, Blue, and Red beaches, and captured the Kimpo airstrip,
allowing for a breakout from the Pusan perimeter.
By the end of September, Seoul was back in South Korean hands.

Continuing their momentum, MacArthur and the ROK went up western Korea and took Pyongyang in October.
MacArthur then thought it was going to be a good idea to keep going straight on into China, but Truman disagreed.
When China entered the war, it led to major Allied losses,
and MacArthur was seriously considering using nuclear weapons to end the war.
MacArthur's Home-by-Christmas Offensive was met with the Chinese Second Phase Offensive,
ambushing and pushing the allied forces back from the Yalu River.

While MacArthur wanted complete surrender from the North Koreans,
Truman wasn't as optimistic about the land war in Asia (he realized it was a classic blunder).
So, Truman relieved MacArthur of his command, and put \textbf{General Matthew Ridgway} in charge.

The rest of the Korean War would mostly be spent in stalemate.
Combat continued during armistice negotiations, which would take a very long time to go through.
Negotiations were held at Kaesong and at Panmunjom.
Battles during the stalemate included:
Pork Chop Hill,
Heartbreak Ridge,
White Horse Mountain,
Hill Eerie,
and the siege of Outpost Harry.
An armistice was agreed on in July 1953, setting up a \textbf{Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)} at the 38th parallel.
The area is still patrolled by members of both sides, and clashes occur sometimes.

\section{Soviet Union After Stalin}

\subsection*{Khrushchev's USSR}
% TODO Gary Powers

In the US, the transfer of leadership from Truman to Eisenhower resulted in policy not changing much,
even though the transition crossed party lines.
The change from Stalin to his successor, \textbf{Nikita Khrushchev}, however, was big.
Stalin died in 1953, and the Communist Party named Khrushchev, his right hand man, First Secretary.

During some collective leadership, Khrushchev consolidated power.
He gave his \textbf{secret speech}, ``On the Personality Cult and Its Consequences'',
to the 20th Party Congress of the Communist Party,
denouncing Stalin and the crimes that Stalin had committed:
\begin{quote}
  We have to consider seriously and analyze correctly [the crimes of the Stalin era]
  in order that we may preclude any possibility of a repetition in any form whatever
  of what took place during the life of Stalin,
  who absolutely did not tolerate collegiality in leadership and in work,
  and who practiced brutal violence, not only toward everything which opposed him,
  but also toward that which seemed to his capricious and despotic character, contrary to his concepts.
\end{quote}
Even though his speech was supposed to be secret, it ended up getting leaked.
Khrushchev ended up being named Premier of the USSR in 1958.

While in power, Khrushchev used the Virgin Lands Campaign to try and improve agricultural productivity.
He oversaw some liberalization and de-Stalinization, in a period known as the Khrushchev Thaw.
At one point, Lazar Kaganovich and Vyacheslav Molotov, the Anti-Party group, tried to overthrow him
and replace him with his Prime Minister, Nikolai Bulganin.

\subsection*{The Cuban Situation}
% Cuban Missile Crisis

To contextualize this part,
we need to go back a bit and take a look at where Cuba was at this point in time, and how it got there.
In 1952, \textbf{Fulgencio Batista} became dictator of Cuba.
Batista had been elected President after overthrowing Carlos Prio Socarras in 1940.
Around this time,
a young lawyer named \textbf{Fidel Castro} decided that he didn't like Batista and wanted to depose him.
He teamed up with his brother \textbf{Raul Castro} and led an attack on Moncada Barracks in July 1953.
They failed badly and ended up in prison in Model Prison on the Isle of Pines.
In his own defense, Castro gave the ``History Will Absolve Me'' speech in court:
\begin{quote}
  I know that imprisonment will be harder for me than it has ever been for anyone,
  filled with cowardly threats and hideous cruelty.
  But I do not fear prison,
  as I do not fear the fury of the miserable tyrant who took the lives of 70 of my comrades.
  Condemn me.
  It does not matter.
  \textbf{History will absolve me.}
\end{quote}

When they got out, the Castros went to Mexico, and met \textbf{Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara}.
While they were there, they set up the \textbf{26th of July Movement} and prepared to take down Batista again,
named after the date of the failed Moncada Barracks attack.

In December 1956, Fidel and less than a hundred men took the yacht \textit{Granma}
(incidentally, the newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party would be named \textit{Granma} in its honor)
to Cuba, landing with the intention of taking the island.
They were promptly decimated by Batista's men, but Castro escaped into the Sierra Maestra mountains.
From there, he and Guevara ran a guerrilla campaign against Batista.
Every time Batista tried to take down the rebellion, he failed.
At this point, the US imposed trade restrictions on Cuba and told Batista to get out of town,
and Batista left the island in January 1959, allowing Castro to take over.

Of course, the Americans weren't particularly happy with the fact that Cuba (only 90 miles from Key West)
was under the dictatorial control of a Communist.
So, the US severed diplomatic ties with Castro's Cuba.
In April 1961, the CIA executed a plan to take down the Castro regime.
The idea for the \textbf{Bay of Pigs invasion} (Operation Zapata)
had been created under the Eisenhower administration,
but it was executed four months into Kennedy's administration (more on Kennedy later).

The CIA idea was to arm 1,400 Cuban exiles known as Brigade 2506
and empower them to establish ``a new government with which the United States can live in peace''.
On April 15, the brigade got on a boat from Guatemala and landed on Playa Gir\'on, initially making some gains.
Then, everything proceeded to go south.
During Operation Falcon, the drop of 150 paratroopers failed to take their objective,
and retreat into the Escambray Mountains was impossible.
So, most of the brigade was captured and interrogated.

Kennedy took full responsibility for the failure,
and the invasion was a contributing factor to the dismissal of Allen Dulles as director of the CIA in late 1961.
Following the Bay of Pigs, the Kennedy administration began Operation Mongoose,
a more covert sabotage campaign against Castro, making Castro hate the US even more.

Castro was fairly closely allied with Khrushchev at this point, them both being Communists.
After the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion,
Khrushchev agreed to Castro's request for nuclear missiles on the island.
Khrushchev was pleased with the arrangement,
especially in light of the fact that the US had missiles in Italy and Turkey within range of Moscow.

This was October 1962, so a US election was underway,
The US confirmed missile preparations when Richard Heyser flew a U-2 plane over Cuba,
taking pictures of new bases under construction at San Cristobal.
Kennedy's administration was criticized about the nuclear missiles sitting 90 miles off the Florida coast.
At this point, the US blockaded Cuba and demanded that all the existing missiles there should be dismantled.

Negotiations in the United Nations Security Council were mediated by Secretary General U Thant,
and Ambassador \textbf{Adlai Stevenson} discussed the situation in Cuba with Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin:
\begin{quote}
  Do you, Ambassador Zorin, deny that the USSR has placed
  and is placing medium and intermediate range missiles and sites in Cuba?
  Yes or no?
  Don't wait for the translation: yes or no?
  \textbf{I am prepared to wait for my answer until hell freezes over, if that's your decision.}
\end{quote}
Stevenson then proceeded to present a series of pictures taken by the U-2 to the Security Council.
During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy put together EXCOMM,
a group of National Security Council members and friends, to help advise him during the situation.
The crisis was resolved by the Hotline Agreement,
in which the US agreed to dismantle the Jupiter Missiles threatening Moscow,
and a new hotline was set up between Kennedy's and Khrushchev's offices.

\subsection*{Brezhnev in Power}

When the Soviets got tired of Khrushchev in 1964,
they ousted him and placed \textbf{Leonid Brezhnev} in his place as First Secretary.
He'd previously been in charge of the Virgin Lands Campaign, and now he took full power.
Brezhnev would consolidate power, setting up his Brezhnev Doctrine,
allowing intervention if socialist countries decided to turn to capitalism.
A prime example of the use of his doctrine is the invasion of Czechoslovakia during Prague Spring
(more on the Czech situation later).
He also ordered the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

When Brezhnev took over, the Era of Stagnation began.
The economy, politics, and social change all more or less came to a standstill,
and they would stay that way until Gorbachev took over in the mid-80s.

\section{Vietnam War}
% Tet Offensive
% My Lai
% Gulf of Tonkin
% Kent State
% William Westmoreland

Before we get to how this proxy war was fought, let's first take a look at history in southeast Asia.
France had begun to conquer Indochina in the 1850s, and in 1888,
\textbf{French Indochina} was colonized in present-day Cambodia and Vietnam.
Vietnamese forces tried to oppose French rule for quite a while,
but the most successful were the \textbf{Viet Minh}, founded in 1941,
and controlled by the Communist Party.
While France was occupied by Germany, the Indochinese government sided with the Vichy regime.
The Viet Minh opposed French occupation, and they fought the Japanese who tried to take over as well.

When Japan lost World War~II, Japanese forces in Vietnam were inactive,
and Viet Minh forces took over the country in the \textbf{August Revolution}.
\textbf{Ho Chi Minh} led meetings to create the independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Hanoi.
At this point, the Viet Minh were fairly popular.
However, all the Allies who had won World War~II thought the area should belong to France.
British and Nationalist Chinese forces took the country and then ceded control to France.
Ho Chi Minh wasn't particularly happy with this development,
and the Viet Minh began a guerrilla campaign, resulting in the \textbf{First Indochina War}.
The war fanned out, including Laos and Cambodia, home to the Pathet Lao and the Khmer Serei respectively.

By 1950, the People's Republic of China and the USSR were helping the Viet Minh take back their country.
The French and Americans began to seriously consider using tactical nuclear weapons,
but Eisenhower decided against it.
During negotiations, the US sailed recon flights over Dien Bien Phu based off carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin.

The \textbf{Battle of Dien Bien Phu} would signal the end of French occupation of Indochina.
Viet Minh commander Vo Nguyen Giap served up a decisive defeat against the French,
partly because the French underestimated the Viet Minh following a French victory at Na San.
Following a good amount of trench warfare, Giap ordered a full assault, capturing 10,000 prisoners.

After Dien Bien Phu, Vietnam was partitioned at the \textbf{17th parallel},
and under the Geneva Accords, people were allowed to move between the two new countries for a short period of time.
North Vietnam instituted agrarian reform, setting up a campaign against land owners.

In the south, \textbf{Bao Dai} was instituted as emperor, and \textbf{Ngo Dinh Diem} was appointed prime minister.
Diem quickly moved to crush all his opponents in his pursuit of the destruction of communism,
and he set himself up to win elections by the end of 1955.
Winning as much as 133\% of the vote in some places\footnote{Yes, he rigged the election.},
Diem was elected president of a new independent Republic of Vietnam on October 26, 1955.
Supported by the Americans (Eisenhower had no real alternative),
Diem instituted his ``Denounce the Communists'' campaign, killing and torturing communists across the country.

By 1957, insurgency was starting to take root.
People were getting fed up with Diem's government, but they were disorganized.
In late 1960, the National Liberation Front, aka Viet Cong, was created in an attempt to organize the activists.
The Viet Cong wanted American influence out of Vietnam.
By 1960, North Vietnam decided to start helping, and they invaded Laos.
In 1962, multiple countries got together and agreed to respect Laos's neutrality.

The South Vietnamese ARVN army was more or less incompetent in the face of the Viet Cong.
At the Battle of Ap Bac, the Viet Cong defeated the ARVN, despite having many disadvantages.
In the middle of 1963, the US started discussing a change of leadership in South Vietnam.
The CIA looked the other way when some generals overthrew Diem and killed him.
After the coup, chaos reigned supreme.

\section{The Wall Comes Down}

\subsection*{Reagan \& Thatcher}
