\courtcase{Marbury v.\ Madison}{1803}{John Marshall}

John Adams, on his last day in office, named a bunch of new judges under the Organic Act.
The judges are referred to as the ``Midnight Judges''.
The commissions weren't honored by Thomas Jefferson, because he said they were invalid.
\textbf{William Marbury}, who would have gotten an appointment as a Justice of the Peace in D.C.,
petitioned Jefferson's Secretary of State, \textbf{James Madison},
to give the commissions using \textbf{writs of mandamus}.

Marbury didn't get the commission, and the Judiciary Act was ruled unconstitutional.
Marshall wrote the majority opinion, and William Cushing and Alfred Moore notably didn't take part in the ruling.
The case is notable because it established \textbf{judicial review},
the process by which the courts can find acts of Congress unconstitutional.
