\chapter{Early United States}

Let's head back to the US and see what the early days of the country were like.

\section{First Years}

\subsection*{George Washington}
% TODO Whiskey Rebellion

The first president was \textbf{George Washington},
who was unanimously elected to the position by the electoral college.
His vice president was \textbf{John Adams},
and his First Lady was Martha Washington.

Washington created a Cabinet with four departments: State, War, Treasury, and Justice.
As Secretary of State, he appointed \textbf{Thomas Jefferson}.
As Secretary of War, he appointed \textbf{Henry Knox},
who had helped him with artillery at Trenton;
Knox would be succeeded by Timothy Pickering.
As Secretary of Treasury, he appointed \textbf{Alexander Hamilton}.

\textbf{John Jay}, one of the authors of the Federalist Papers, was sent to negotiate a treaty with Britain.
There had been dispute in the US regarding the evacuation of forts in the Northwest Territories and the Great Lakes.
\textbf{Jay's Treaty} didn't solve the fact that British ships had been impressing sailors onto their boats,
and some people like Thomas Jefferson thought that it was too friendly to the British.
Popular outrage led to Jay being burned in effigy.

Washington's Farewell Address is notable because it offered advice to the new country.
Washington talked about the importance of law and of national unity
He warned against making entangling alliances and said that the US should focus on American affairs.
``Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure,
reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality
can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.''

\subsection*{John Adams}

Washington's vice president, John Adams, succeeded him.
Adams's cousin Sam Adams had led the Sons of Liberty,
and his First Lady was Abigail Adams.
Adams was the first president to live in the White House.

In the \textbf{XYZ Affair}, three French diplomats demanded bribes from Americans.
In response, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney is thought to have said either
``No, no, not a sixpence!'' or ``Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute''.

John Adams also signed the \textbf{Alien and Sedition Acts},
a set of four laws passed in 1798 during the Quasi-War with France.
The fourth one was important because it made it criminal to criticize the government and president.
James Madison and Thomas Jefferson opposed the Federalist perspective that these laws created,
as they were clearly designed to weaken the Democratic-Republican party.
So, they wrote the \textbf{Kentucky Resolution} and \textbf{Virginia Resolution},
which resulted in the Acts being deemed unconstitutional.

\subsection*{Thomas Jefferson}
% Barbary War
% Embargo Act
% Louisiana Purchase/Lewis & Clark
% Adams-Onis

\textbf{Thomas Jefferson} was John Adams's Vice President.
He was elected president in 1800, in an election against Aaron Burr ---
the election had to be decided by the House of Representatives
because Burr and Jefferson were tied in electoral votes.
Jefferson's Treasury Secretary was originally Albert Gallatin, who wanted to reduce taxes.
His second Vice President would be \textbf{George Clinton}.

\textbf{Aaron Burr} was Jefferson's first Vice President.
He had served in the army during the Revolution, and had become a successful lawyer since.
During his time as President of the Senate, the Senate impeached Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase.
At the end of his term as Vice President, Burr faced Alexander Hamilton in a duel.
Burr shot and killed Hamilton, but was never tried.

Burr then went west, looking for new opportunities.
After he tried to help Mexico overthrow its Spanish rule and take parts of the Louisiana Purchase for himself,
Burr was indicted on charges of treason and imprisoned in Fort Soddet.
The plot was exposed by James Wilkinson, who had sent a letter to Jefferson
after seeing letters to Anthony Merry and the Marquis of Casa Yrujo.
Burr's forces had notably assembled on Blennerhassett Island.
His defense attorneys were Edmund Randolph, John Wickham, and Luther Martin.
He was acquitted since treason requires two witnesses or an admission of guilt.
