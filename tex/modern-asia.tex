\chapter{Early Modern Asia}

We've been focused mostly on Europe for a while,
but let's take a moment to look at what was happening in the east.
This'll be a short chapter, but it's important as a transitional period in history.

\section{Tsars of Russia}

Russia is in both Asia and Europe,
and because the Renaissance and Reformation chapter doesn't really deal with Russia,
it's in this chapter on Asia.

\subsection*{Background}

The Mongols that we saw in the Middle Ages were taking up a fairly large amount of space in Russia.
But the Mongols (Tatars), from their capital at Sarai,
generally left the princes of south and east Russia alone as long as they paid their taxes.

The princes generally cared more about the Northern Crusaders in the 13th century,
who were led by the Teutonic Knights and the Swedes.
\textbf{Alexander Nevsky}, prince of Novgorod, was hailed as a hero as a result of his victories.
Under the Mongols, the Russians developed an infrastructure and became much more organized.

\subsection*{Grand Duchy of Moscow}

The son of Alexander Nevsky, Daniil Aleksandrovich, founded Moscow,
a polity that would force the Tatars from Russia.
In 1380, the Mongols were defeated at Kulikovo by Grand Prince Dmitry Donskoy.

By the 15th century, princes of Moscow were going around and taking as much land as they could.
Most successful among these was \textbf{Ivan~III} (1462--1505), Grand Prince of Moscow,
who began the foundations for the Russian state itself.
He annexed Novgorod and Tver, and defeated the Lithuanian armies at the Battle of Verdosha River,
tripling the size of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.
He also notably greatly renovated the Moscow Kremlin, and he was called ``sovereign of all Russia''.
His attacks would begin the eventual complete destruction of the once great Golden Horde.

\subsection*{Tsardom and Troubles}

The power that had been centralizing in Moscow became truly great during the time of
Tsar \textbf{Ivan~IV, the Terrible} (1547--1584), a Rurikid Dynasty ruler.
He was the first to be called ``tsar'', and he made his position stronger than ever before.
He set up a new code of laws (the Sudebnik), and he created the Zemsky Sobor, the first Russian representative body.
He waged the Livonian War to take the Baltic, but he failed, and he asked Pope Gregory~XIII for help.
Ivan also supposedly blinded the architect of St.\ Basil's Cathedral.

Later in life, Ivan proceeded to divide his lands into two, one of which was the \textit{oprichnina}.
His secret police, the Oprichniki, conducted the massacre of Novgorod because Ivan was suspicious of Archbishop Pimen.
Ivan ended up killing his heir Ivan Ivanovich,
and was therefore succeeded by the mostly incompetent \textbf{Feodor~I}.

Feodor's reign was mostly actually run by \textbf{Boris Godunov},
who usurped the Tsardom after Feodor died childless.
Godunov's later reign was full of civil wars, such as one against Grigori Otrepiev, a False Dmitri.
So, Russia descended into the \textbf{Time of Troubles}.

Russia would end up mostly surviving the Time of Troubles, despite the Russo-Polish war and the Ingrian war.
We'll look at the reemergence of the Tsars later --- Russia will be more a part of European history from now on.

\section{Shoguns of Japan}

Conspicuously missing from topics thus far,
Japan actually did have history happening before the 16th century.
A lot of ancient Japanese history doesn't come up too often,
so we'll start with classical Japan, for which we'll go back in time a bit.

\subsection*{Classical Japan}

Classical Japanese periods are named after their capital cities.

During the Asuka period (538--710), the Japanese polities began to become a truly centralized state,
and the three kingdoms of Korea were still in conflict.
Buddhism moved to Japan.

The Asuka period was succeeded by the Nara period of the 8th century.
Nara was generally considered a golden age of prosperity and progress.

The final period of classical Japan is the \textbf{Heian period} (794--1185).
It's noted for art and literature, and Lady Shikibu Murasaki wrote the \textit{Tale of Genji}.
Notable aristocratic families included the Fujiwara clan, who took control of the imperial family.
They faced the Hogen Rebellion, Heiji Rebellion, and Gempei War.
The Gempei War ended with the Battle of Dan-no-ura, when Minamoto clan won.
Then, the first Shogun was Yoritomo of the Minamoto clan, signaling an end to the power of the Fujiwara.

\subsection*{Feudal Japan}

Medieval Japan was controlled by \textit{daimyo}, powerful families, and \textit{shogun}, military warlords.
The emperor was mostly a figurehead.

Recall that the Mongols tried to invade Japan in 1274 and 1281.
They were deterred by the \textit{kamikaze}, the famous typhoon that saved Japan.

Fast forward a bit past a bunch of mildly important Shogunates,
and we get to the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1569--1603).
The first great unifier of Japan was \textbf{Oda Nobunaga} (1534--1582).
He was killed in a revolt in 1582,
and true unification was completed by his general \textbf{Toyotomi Hideyoshi},
the second great unifier of Japan.
Hideyoshi tried to conquer the Ming dynasty in China, but he died.

\textbf{Tokugawa Ieyasu}, a student of Oda Nobunaga, was a regent for Hideyoshi's heir.
At the \textbf{Battle of Sekigahara}, Tokugawa defeated Ishida Mitsunari, general of Toyotomi Hideyori.
He became the third great unifier of Japan and the first leader of Japan's final shogunate.
The Tokugawa Shogunate's crest was three hollyhock leaves.
Tokugawa created a ``four-class'' system of warriors, artists, farmers, and merchants,
and he also created the sankin-kotai system of government.
He destroyed the Toyotomi clan completely after the Siege of Osaka,
where he used the excavation of moats (that he had filled in himself) as an excuse to start the attack.
The Tokugawa would start a period of seclusion (sakoku) because of the Shimabara Rebellion.

The Tokugawa Shogunate stayed in power for quite a while, so let's go look at India.

\section{Mughals of India}

In 1526, \textbf{Babur}, a descendant of Tamerlane,
had tried multiple times to take Samarkand, but had failed and decided to go away.
He set up in Kabul, and went through the Khyber Pass into India.
After he defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the First Battle of Panipat, Babur took most of the north of India.
He defeated the Rajputs at the Battle of Khanwa to increase his strength.
Babur's son was Humayun, who didn't have a very stable empire,
and was pushed into Persia by rebellions led by people like Sher Shah.

In 1555, Humayun was able to come back to India, but he promptly tripped on some stairs and died.
Humayun's son \textbf{Akbar} succeeded him as a 12-year-old.
The young Akbar was assisted by his regent Bairam Khan,
and in 1556, he defeated Hemu the Grocer and his Sur armies at the Second Battle of Panipat.
After the battle, Akbar reportedly didn't behead Hemu,
and instead pointed to a picture that he had drawn of Hemu bleeding on the ground,
saying that he had already killed him, and denying him any final honor.
He built a new capital at Fatehpur Sikri (his ``city of victory''),
and he ended Rajput wars by marrying Mariam uz-Zamani.
Akbar made a system of \textit{diwans} to make sure that finances were handled correctly.
He built the Jama Masjid around the tomb of the mystic Salim Chishti,
and even named his eldest son after him.

Akbar's son was \textbf{Jahangir} ruled a spectacular era of the Mughal empire.
But he was an opium addict and wasn't a great ruler.
Jahangir's son was \textbf{Shah Jahan}, who brought the Mughal empire to a new peak.
He rebuilt and renovated the Red Fort, and he had a Peacock Throne with lots of gems on it.
He put the Koh-i-noor diamond in the \textbf{Taj Mahal}, a mausoleum he built in Agra for his wife Mumtaz.
Shah Jahan's eldest son was Dara Shikoh, and his younger son was \textbf{Aurangzeb}.
In a battle for succession, Aurangzeb killed Data after the Battle of Samugarh in 1659.
Shah Jahan was declared incompetent and spent the end of his life locked up by Aurangzeb in the Red Fort.
