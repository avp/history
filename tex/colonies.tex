\chapter{Colonies in the New World}

Remember that Europeans had been colonizing the New World for a while.
Let's look at what was happening across the Atlantic,
and the new colonies and societies that formed there.

\section{Pilgrims and Plymouth}

Around the turn of the 17th century,
some Puritans in England didn't like the atmosphere of turmoil and persecution that they faced.
These men included the Separatists in Scrooby, and they decided to go to Holland.
They lived in Leiden, Holland for a while, but they didn't really like the Dutch culture.
So, they decided to leave.

In 1620, the ship Speedwell left from Delftshaven with the colonists,
and met up with the \textbf{Mayflower} and they moved west.
Speedwell was taking on water, but after an attempt to fix it, they decided to sell the ship.
Passengers on the Mayflower included Miles Standish, John Alden, and William Bradford.
On the voyage, a passenger named John Howland went overboard, but they got him back on board.
A baby born on the voyage was named Oceanus, and the only passenger to die was William Button.

On the way there, they drafted a contract, the \textbf{Mayflower Compact},
which was signed by 41 men on the ship, including John Billington, George Soule, and Edward Winslow.
It organized these \textbf{Pilgrims} into a ``civil body politick''.

When they landed at \textbf{Plymouth}, Thomas Hunt and others kidnapped some Patuxet.
One of the abductees was \textbf{Squanto}, who helped the Pilgrims.
